### The Old Testament
The old testament dates back to ancient egypt. Since then, thousands of years have passed. Two spiritual cycles have come and gone. Inevitably, due to the nature of human corruption, the old testament is corrupted beyond recognition. It does not sit well with the spiritual ideals of the west. The corruption can be observed through fearful language and negated propositions. 

#### Fear of GOD
There is recurring mention of fear of GOD in the Torah. There is no reason to fear GOD. GOD is all loving and all powerful. Fear is the result of premature violence. Fear is the abscence of GOD. Loving GOD is the key to Heaven. Love and acceptance of one self and Love for all of nature. Fear is an illusion.

#### Genesis
The language of the bible has intricate structure with clear and perfect definitions. Without a consistent use of language, a text is meaningless. The consistency of the Bible can be heavily scrutinized. If one is to believe that the old testament has survived human corrution, one has to suspend logical thinking into believing GOD speaks inconsistently. It that was the case, reality would be inconsistent. 

One clear sign of corruption is found early in Genesis. 

"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."

Man does not have dominion over the creatures of the world. Man is equal to all living creatures. Man does not subdue. Man lives in harmony with nature. These are additions that are inevitable in times of corruption. The corrupt lead with fear, control, and domination. The just live in peace and harmony. 

#### The Ten Commandments
The commandents bear no resemblance to Godly language. God does not command prohibitions. God does not speak in negations. Every concievable image can be both sacred and profane. Even killing can be sacred. The question is what the underlying motive is. Sensless killing of the innocent is profane. Killing the violent rapist is sacred. If humans do not bear the resposibility of killing when killing is necessary, we cannot claim to protect life. The prohibition of killing is added by those who want arbitrate killing for their own purpose. 

Honoring parents has no purpose. Honorable people are honored. Dishonorable people are dishonered. There is no virtue in honoring parents for reasons of parenthood. All honor is earned. Parents should honor their childrens freedom.

"Thou shall not commit adultery"

This is interpreted to mean that having sex oustide of a marriage is a sin. 

It is the one who gives himself the right to interfere in the sexual pleasures of others who is sinning. Man does not own his wife, neither does wife own her husband. Sex is a natural part of life. It is sacred when two people share the intimate act in love and consentual understanding. It is profane to use another for his own sexual pleasures or to hinder another to live as they please.

It is the tho belief of placing importance on words such as husband and wife, and create rules and illusions around those concepts that is adultorous in a broader sense. Adultery is to disgrace the natural order.

Taking the Lords name in vain does not mean to utter the sound GOD in ways that are disagreeable to some. That sound is arbitrary. The Lords name is the language of nature. One is taking the Lords name in vain by beliving in the many rules of the wicked. 

Commandments are not necessary. God does not need to command. God created the Heavens and the Earth to be freely and honestly explored. God is the all in which life has its course. Godliness is discovered. The relationship to GOD is personal. It is sacred. It is not to be trusted onto insitutions. Religious institutions are a sign of spiritual decay. 

The only thing that needs to be said is to Love GOD, and not idolize. Loving GOD means to love all of creation and all of the experiece. There are no limits, only endless possibilities. 

"Thou shall not steal"

This again begs the question. Is there sacred theft? Who defines what constitues theft and what constitues anothers propoerty and not? Stealing is sacred if the theft takes from the greedy and gives to the poor. Stealing is profane when the greedy live in illusion of what is their propoerty. 

The GOD of the old testament, as it is portrayed, is the image of a wicked corrupt degenerate. 

### The New Testament
The New Testament has also not survived the test of time for the reasons of spiritual cycles and inevitable corruption. It is a sin to believe that text can withstand conrruption for such a long period of time. Given the nature of the fundamental truth, these texts are guarranteed to be corrupted. The author must take measures to protect against corruption. The institutional religious makes unilateral decisions to change texts as they please.  

The New Testament was written by the Greek philosopher Plato. It is the story of the spiritual pattern that plays itself out at the end of each spiritual cycle. There is no historical person named Jesus Christ. There is no evidence to support this claim. Jesus Christ is a translation from a word that once had meaning. It is not the name of a character. Christ denotes spiritual rank. Jesus, greek Youshua, means GOD saves. Jesus Christ translates to GOD saves the anointed one. 

There are no apostles. The text is written in repitition with the purpose of fooling the wicked into apostacy. The text has a key that can decode its true meaning. It is a method that shakes out the corruption and leaves what is sacred.
