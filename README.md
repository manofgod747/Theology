## Duality
Duality is the idea that everything that exists has a two fold nature. If something is possible, the inversion of it is a neccessity. If there is something to call white, there needs to be not white in order for white to exist. In order for life to exist, death is a must. If we are to call something good, the negation of it must be possible. Every concept must have a background over which the concept gains visibility. The existence of the concept makes the background into a neccesity.

## Trauma
Trauma is the underlying mechanism that drives the narratives of this universe. Trauma is defined as unbearable violence and fear that results in the soul disconnecting from the body. The soul returns to the body after the danger has passed. The time the soul is absent creates a split in the mind. The split contains the memory of the trauma. The souls is unconscious of the memory until it is remebered. The unseen memory echoes thorough the body, creating paranoid delusions and pains the body.

The traumatic memory is the cause of pain and suffering. It is what propagates violence, jealousy, anger, hatred and ignorance.

Trauma is the negation of wellness. Wellness and trauma in different combination sets the foundation of grand narratives. It relates to the concepts of Good and Evil.

## Sin
Sin means self deception. Sins are not a list of prohibitions and cultural taboos. A sin is to decieve one self that something that isn't the case is the case. One can be in sin for different reasons. One category of reason is trauma. Trauma disconnects the soul from the body and the soul looses touch with the traumatic memory. The sin is the living of a life under false pretenses.

Another reason for sin is manipulation. Psychological warfare. This type of sin can subdue the weak mind into believing in things that are not true. Self doubt and hatred are some of the things manipulation can lead to.

## The Sacred and the Profane
Life is sacred. Living beings living in harmony with nature is sacred. Life acting out its will in unison with nature is sacred. 

Profane is the opposite of sacred. Living in disharmony and agony is profane. The sacred and the profane can be visualized as two equal images with different meaning. The question of what image is sacred and what is profane cannot be answered from the image alone. It is the motives behind the images that determines the case.

Imagine an image of a mother stabbig her child to death. This image may seems profane. It may seem unholy. But wether that is the case, depends on the reasons as to why it is taking place. In what affects is the mother acting? What is her reason? In what affect is the child? Does the child have a reason for being stabbed?

To answer this question, imagine that this child is born in a cesarean birth. There is no birth trauma. For this reason, the child has her memory of past lifes intact. The child has the spiritual development of a wise mage. When the child develops her ability to speak, her wisdom becomes clear to the audience.

The child then decides at an early age to have her life taken from her by her mother. The reason for this is a public display of gratitude. A display of how something seemingly so horrible can be sacred. The virgin sacrifice.

If the mother refused to help the child to do her will, she would be acting in disharmony and agony against the childs will. The mother can perform this act out of Love for her child. In respect for the will of the other, even though the image might seem profane to some. 

In this sense, there is nothing sacred or profane about a pattern. Patterns are arbitrary. It is the underlying motives that determine what is sacred, and what is profane. 

## Good and Evil
Good and evil are concept of this universe arising from the fact of wellnes and trauma. 

## The Spiritual Cycle

### Incest, Pedofilia, and Rape

## The Bible
### The Old Testament
The old testament dates back to ancient egypt. Since then, thousands of years have passed. Two spiritual cycles have come and gone. Inevitably, due to the nature of human corruption, the old testament is corrupted beyond recognition. It does not sit well with the spiritual ideals of the west. The corruption can be observed through fearful language and negated propositions. 

#### Fear of GOD
There is recurring mention of fear of GOD in the Torah. There is no reason to fear GOD. GOD is all loving and all powerful. Fear is the result of premature violence. Fear is the abscence of GOD. Loving GOD is the key to Heaven. Love and acceptance of one self and Love for all of nature. Fear is an illusion.

#### Genesis
The language of the bible has intricate structure with clear and perfect definitions. Without a consistent use of language, a text is meaningless. The consistency of the Bible can be heavily scrutinized. If one is to believe that the old testament has survived human corruption, one has to suspend logical thinking into believing GOD speaks inconsistently. If that was the case, reality would be inconsistent. 

One clear sign of corruption is found early in Genesis. 

"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."

Man does not have dominion over the creatures of the world. Man is equal to all living creatures. Man does not subdue. Man lives in harmony with nature. These are additions that are inevitable in times of corruption. The corrupt lead with fear, control, and domination. The just live in peace and harmony. 

#### The Ten Commandments
The commandents bear no resemblance to Godly language. God needs not command prohibitions. The laws of nature are inherent and discoverable. 

"Thou shall not kill"

Every concievable image can be both sacred and profane. Even killing can be sacred. The question is what the underlying motive is. Sensless killing of the innocent is profane. Killing the violent rapist is sacred. If humans do not bear the resposibility of killing when killing is necessary, we cannot claim to protect life. The prohibition of killing is added by those who want to arbitrate killing for their own purpose.

Honoring parents has no purpose. Honorable people are honored. Dishonorable people are dishonered. There is no virtue in honoring parents for reasons of parenthood. All honor is earned. Parents should honor their childrens freedom instead of imposing rules of parental honor.

"Thou shall not commit adultery"

This is interpreted to mean that having sexual relations oustide of a marriage is a sin. 

It is the one who gives him or herself the right to interfere in the sexual relations of others who is sinning. Man and Woman do not own each other. Sex is a natural part of life. It is sacred when people Love. It is profane to engange in sexual relations with unwilling parties.

Placing importance on words such as husband and wife is the sin. To abide by social rules, norms, and illusions around those concepts is the true adultery in a broader sense. Adultery is to disgrace the natural order.

"Do not take the Lords name in vain"

Taking the Lords name in vain does not mean to utter the sound GOD or Elohim in ways that are disagreeable to some. The sound is arbitrary. The Lords name is the language of nature. One is taking the Lords name in vain by beliving in the many rules of the wicked. 

Commandments are not necessary. GOD does not need to command. GOD created the Heavens and the Earth to be freely and honestly explored. GOD is the all in which life has its course. Godliness is discovered. The relationship to GOD is personal. It is sacred. It is not to be trusted onto insitutions. Religious institutions are a sign of spiritual decay. 

The only thing that needs to be said is to Love GOD, and not idolize. Loving GOD means to love all of creation and all of the experiece. There are no limits, only endless possibilities. 

"Thou shall not steal"

This again begs the question. Is there sacred theft? Who defines what constitues theft and what constitues anothers property and not? Stealing is sacred if the theft takes from the greedy and gives to the poor. Stealing is profane when the greedy live in illusion of unearned property.

The GOD of the old testament, as it is portrayed, is the image of corruption.

### The New Testament
The New Testament has also not survived the test of time for the same reasons as the Old Testament. It is a sin to believe that text can withstand corruption for such a long period of time. Given the nature of the fundamental truth, these texts are guarranteed to be corrupted. The author must take measures to protect against corruption. The institutional religious make unilateral decisions to change texts as they please, as if they were the lawmakers of the universe. The sin is to live by such a tenet and be a follower of such.

The New Testament was written by the Greek philosopher Plato approx 400 B.C.E. It is a simple spiritual teaching and the story of the spiritual pattern that plays itself out at the end of each spiritual cycle. There is no historical person named Jesus Christ. There is no evidence to support this claim. Jesus Christ is translated from a word that once had meaning. It is not the name of a character. Christ denotes spiritual rank. Jesus, greek Youshua, means GOD saves. Jesus Christ translates to GOD saves the anointed one. 

There are no apostles. The text is written in repitition with the purpose of fooling the wicked into apostasy. The text has a key that can decode its true meaning. It is a method that shakes out the corruption and leaves what is sacred.

The new Testament is written in a language that is hard to fully grasp for the uninitiated. It's meaning is deeper and more profound than one might think. This is especially true for Revelations. The meaning of Revelations is revealed to those who are ready for the message. For the uninitiated, it looks like a symbolic poem.
