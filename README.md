### Incest, Pedofilia, and Rape

## The Bible
### The Old Testament
The old testament dates back to ancient egypt. Since then, thousands of years have passed. Two spiritual cycles have come and gone. Inevitably, due to the nature of human corruption, the old testament is corrupted beyond recognition. It does not sit well with the spiritual ideals of the west. The corruption can be observed through fearful language and negated propositions. 

#### Fear of GOD
There is recurring mention of fear of GOD in the Torah. There is no reason to fear GOD. GOD is all loving and all powerful. Fear is the result of premature violence. Fear is the abscence of GOD. Loving GOD is the key to Heaven. Love and acceptance of one self and Love for all of nature. Fear is an illusion.

#### Genesis
The language of the bible has an intricate structure with clear and perfect definitions. Without a consistent use of language, a text is meaningless. The consistency of the Bible can be heavily scrutinized. If one is to believe that the old testament has survived human corrution, one has to suspend logical thinking into believing GOD speaks inconsistently. It that was the case, reality would be inconsistent. 

One clear sign of corruption is found early in Genesis. 

"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."

Man does not have dominion over the creatures of the world. Man is equal to all living creatures. Man does not subdue. Man lives in harmony with nature. These are additions that are inevitable is times of corruption. 

#### The Ten Commandments
The commandents bear no resemblance to Godly language. God does not command prohibitions. God does not speak in negations. Every concievable image can be both sacred and profane. Even killing can be sacred. The question is what the underlying motive is. Sensless killing of the innocent is profane. Killing the violent rapist is sacred. If humans do not bear the resposibility of killing when killing is necessary, we cannot claim to protect life.

Honoring parents has no purpose. Honorable people are honored. Dishonorable people are dishonered. There is no virtue in honoring parents for reasons of parenthood. All honor is earned. Parents should honor their childrens freedom.

"Thou shall not commit adultery"

this is a commandment that is the negation of the truth. It is the one who gives himself the right to interfere in the sexual pleasures of free people who is in sin. Man does not own his wife, neither does wife own her husband. Sex is a natural part of life. It is sacred when two people share the intimate act in love and consentual understanding. It is profane to use another for ones own sexual pleasures or to hinder another to live as they please. 

Commandments are not necessary. God does not need to command. God is the all in which life has its course. Godliness is discovered. The relationship to GOD is personal. It is sacred. It is not to be trusted onto insitutions. Religious institutions are a sign of spiritual decay. 

"Thou shall not steal"

This again behs the question. Is the sacred theft? Who defines what constitues theft and what constitues another propoerty and not. Stealing is sacred if the theft takes from the greedy and gives to the poor.
